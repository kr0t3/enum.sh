# ðŸŽ¯ Online Subdomain Detect Script 


**This is a fork. (mine one)
 I dont care about nothing more. If you wanted original repo just leave using this link:**

### [https://github.com/cihanmehmet/sub.sh](https://github.com/cihanmehmet/sub.sh/)



```bash
sudo apt-get install jq

./sub.sh webscantest.com
```

I will add the entire process of recon in the future 'cause i want to use this script for personal purpose.


Bye.
